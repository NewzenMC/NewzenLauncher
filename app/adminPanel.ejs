                        <p>
                            Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer,
                            mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist
                            best known for his contributions to the design
                            of the modern alternating current (AC)
                            electrical supply system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tesla started working in the telephony and
                            electrical fields before emigrating to the
                            United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison.
                            He soon struck out on his own with financial
                            backers, setting up laboratories/companies to
                            develop a range of electrical devices. His
                            patented AC induction motor and transformer were
                            licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired
                            Tesla as a consultant to help develop an
                            alternating current system. Tesla is also known
                            for his high-voltage, high-frequency power
                            experiments in New York and Colorado Springs
                            which included patented devices and theoretical
                            work used in the invention of radio
                            communication, for his X-ray experiments, and
                            for his ill-fated attempt at intercontinental
                            wireless transmission in his unfinished
                            Wardenclyffe Tower project.

                        <h1>Leonardo da Vinci</h1>
                        <p>
                            Italian Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor,
                            architect, musician, mathematician, engineer,
                            inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer,
                            botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more
                            than that of any other figure, epitomized the
                            Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often
                            been described as the archetype of the
                            Renaissance Man, a man of "unquenchable
                            curiosity" and "feverishly inventive
                            imagination". He is widely considered to be one
                            of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps
                            the most diversely talented person ever to have
                            lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner,
                            the scope and depth of his interests were
                            without precedent and "his mind and personality
                            seem to us superhuman, the man himself
                            mysterious and remote". Marco Rosci states that
                            while there is much speculation about Leonardo,
                            his vision of the world is essentially logical
                            rather than mysterious, and that the empirical
                            methods he employed were unusual for his time.

                        <p>
                            German-born theoretical physicist who developed
                            the general theory of relativity, one of the two
                            pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum
                            mechanics). While best known for his mass–energy
                            equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been
                            dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), he
                            received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for
                            his services to theoretical physics, and
                            especially for his discovery of the law of the
                            photoelectric effect". The latter was pivotal in
                            establishing quantum theory.

                            Near the beginning of his career, Einstein
                            thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer
                            enough to reconcile the laws of classical
                            mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic
                            field. This led to the development of his
                            special theory of relativity. He realized,
                            however, that the principle of relativity could
                            also be extended to gravitational fields, and
                            with his subsequent theory of gravitation in
                            1916, he published a paper on the general theory
                            of relativity.

                            <p>
                                English physicist and mathematician who is
                                widely regarded as one of the most
                                influential scientists of all time and as a
                                key figure in the scientific revolution. His
                                book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
                                Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of
                                Natural Philosophy"), first published in
                                1687, laid the foundations for most of
                                classical mechanics. Newton also made
                                seminal contributions to optics and shares
                                credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the
                                invention of the infinitesimal calculus.

                                Newton's Principia formulated the laws of
                                motion and universal gravitation that
                                dominated scientists' view of the physical
                                universe for the next three centuries. It
                                also demonstrated that the motion of objects
                                on the Earth and that of celestial bodies
                                could be described by the same principles.
                                By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary
                                motion from his mathematical description of
                                gravity, Newton removed the last doubts
                                about the validity of the heliocentric model
                                of the cosmos.
